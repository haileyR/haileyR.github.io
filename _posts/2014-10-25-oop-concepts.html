       <h2>Ruby Class Vs. Module</h2>
        <p>2014. 10. 25</p>

        <p>I've discusses about Ruby Classes on the last blog <a href = "/blog/t6-oop-concepts.html">posting</a>. Classes can be instantiated and is for object creation. It consists of methods, constants, methods, constants, and variables. Ruby Class's inheritance hierarchy of Class < Module < Object < BasicObject. This can be said that class is a subclass of "Module" which is a subclass of "Object."</p>
        <h3>Module</h3>
          <p>Unlike classes, modules cannot be instantiated and groups methods, constants, and also classes. The benefits of using modules are providing <em>namespace</em> which prevents name clashes and implmenting the <em>mixin</em> facility.

          <h4>Namespace</h4>
          Methods in different modules can have a same name like 'cos' in the example. In this case, each method can be called <code>Name.cos</code> or <code>Trig.cos</code> just as method calling for classes. To use constants defined in modules, we use double colons "::" such as <code>Trig::PI</code>.

          <h4>Mixin</h4>
          Mixin facility allows no need of multiple inheritance.

          Just by using "<code>include</code> module" in a class definition, we can use the included module's methods and constants.
