        <h3>Class definition</h3>
          <p>Class is defined as the below example. It usually has initialize method to initialize the class with/ without arguments.

            Variables with a @ sign are classified as instance variables. These variables are accessable within this class. It can be modified, updated. If we want to read or modify its value outside of the class definition, we can set them with attr_reader to read, attr_writer to write different value to it and attr_accessor to do both. Instead, we want to limit the access as we want for protect the values in some case.

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            Here are some example use of Pastry class.
            <p><img src="/img/classuse.jpg"></p>
            <code>apple_pie = Pastry.new(["flour", "butter", "sugar", "apple"], 5)</code> is making an instance of Pastry class.
            Since we set price as attr_reader <code>attr_reader :price</code>, we can read the value of price outside of the class definition.
