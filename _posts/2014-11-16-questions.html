        <h2>Asking a good question</h2>

            As I have worked on Phase 0 materials, I have googled a lot. It was kind of asking questions to Google. In order to find answers to my questions, I have to use all the key words. Then, how specific does it have to be? For searching on google, limiting key words is good to find many possible questions and answers related to what I want to know. Since mostly the questions are related to coding and debugging, stackoverflow and coding tutorial blog posts are good source of answers. Especially, whenever I find an answers to my coding questions are from stackoverflow with a good questions. First, the title of the questions include the key words that I searched for. They are simple only with key words. The questions are specific with explaining what the result they want to get, but simple enough to be answered and they come with example source code. It will be very good practice to read the questions which have answers that what exactly we are looking for.
