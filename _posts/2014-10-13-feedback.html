        <h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

            <h3>Pairing</h3>
            <p>
              I am the one who prefers to solve a problem alone with a bit of clarification from others as necessary.  Hence, it was a bit difficult to balance the roles of a navigator and a driver. I am not good at explaining things even though I know the material very well, so it has been a good practice to discuss and share my ideas with others. I believe this will improve particularly in explaining coding in ruby.

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Reading the feedbacks is really helpful in many cases. Since I get to know how I am doing and what to improve and what to fix. It definitely helped me. I have to improve explaining the code and my think process more clearly and concisely. I have to keep the pace with my partner in terms of understanding the problems and the codes that we are writing. Even though I felt a bit annoying when writing others feedback since I did not have much thing to say when the pairing went well, now I think I have to spend more time on giving other feedback.
