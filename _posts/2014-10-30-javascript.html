        <h2>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h2>
        <p>2014. 10. 30</p>

        <p>I've discusses about Ruby Hashes few weeks ago <a href = "{% post_url 2014-10-01-arrays-hashes %}">here</a>. This week, I've worked with JavaScript for the first time, and found something interesting. JavaScript Objects are very similar to hashes in Ruby.</p>

        <h3>Hashes in Ruby</h3>

        <h3>JavaScript Objects</h3>
          <p>
          JavaScript Objects are data structures that consist of properties. The properties are like a key-value pair in Ruby hashes, but we say 'name' and 'value' for the objects. Unlike Ruby that has data encapsulation and scopes that restricts access to its objects, there is no restriction on accessing the object properties.</br></br>
          Below example is using the literal method to create a "me" object.
