        <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <p>2014. 10. 24</p>

            When I think of the times in my life where Iâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, Challenge, Accomplishment and Effectiveness values come to my mind.
            The most important value of those to me is 'Accomplishment.' Accomplishing is not for only big tasks. The pleasure coming from accomplishing each goals that I make for every step drives me going further and setting a next goal.</br>
            Recently, I read that happiness is coming from 'hope.' Even though having hope may sounds like waiting for the better future, we actually enjoy the process and the time we take to achieve our goal more than we enjoy after the accomplishment.</br>
            Few weeks ago, my friend talked me about how she is having difficulty in finding a job. This also applies to my situation, too. Encouragement is really important. I believe that we will get to work anyways and if we start, we won't stop for a long time. I hope she and I believe in ourselves and keep going no matter how others judge us. We can show the result. Our accomplishment.
