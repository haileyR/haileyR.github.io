        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <p>2014. 10. 24</p>

          <p>
            After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">Claude M. Steele's presentation on "Identity and Stereotype Threat"</a>, I saw this in the side direction and I thought about my experiences after I got into engineering. I did not know about engineering and many people think that it's for men. After I started engineering studies, people around me kept asking me if it isnt' too hard to study and did not see many girls in engineering. Most of the times, people considered me special. This was good, but unconsciously, I got to think that I was doing something really hard, set a bar low and when I got to meet the low bar, I satiated. That was repeated. I guess that was the stereotype threat that Dr. Steel says and that affected me like that. </br>
            Then, how should I overcome this problem? I am trying something that men dominate quantitatively. When I do worse than others who are mostly men, I might think that it's because I'm different from them and doing what I am is good enough as a woman. Now I think that this might be caused by my thinking that I want to resist that my trial isn't enough. I know that if you try really hard and do not stop, you will obtain what you want. Thinking the cause is from other aspect is just ratialnalization of one's own fault. </br>
            Of course praises are always good. However, it should not be compared with the "identity" such as gender and race. If someone does a work well, it's because they worked hard. Just by saying "Oh wow, you did great. I haven't seen a girl do this thing so good," this might make the girl feels good, but as a result, the girl will think that is enough for her or the girl will think that the men underestimate women in general which is the stereotype threat. </br>
            Avoiding all possible causes of stereotype threat is necessary, but we are living in 21th and the world is still have the problem. We have to really be careful with thinking about the difference. Difference between women and men or between races should not be considered as causation of their ability to do professional work and even other trivial tasks. It is a tough problem to discuss in depth, but gradually I hope the world changes since many professionals try hard to solve this problem.
