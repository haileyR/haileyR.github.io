              <h2>Conflict about my path</h2>
        <p>2014. 11. 05</p>

          <p>
            Recently, I had a conflict with my dad about my going to the state to study more and to find a job there which require a lot of money up front. We were talking about the money that I need for moving to New York, and he did not know that I was planning to stay there until June 2015 and he thought that is a long time and got mad about my obstinate decision of going to the state.</br>
            My parents live in other country, so I facetime with my mom almost everyday and I share what my plan is and how I feel about it. Everything. However, I and my dad talk a lot less. This was the cause of our conflict. He does not know how I think about the path that I take. I and my dad did not need much talk though. We argued, talked and took sometime to think about each other. Yes, we should have shared how I think about my decision and how he sees my decision. I thought I have done enough, but I haven't. </br>
            Since we are family, the conflict is mollified pretty quickly without doing anything for few days. However, if I could go back, I would talk to both of my parents more equally and share my thoughts. I learned that even though parents love me a lot, they cannot know how I feel and what I think. I am the one who is responsible for sharing my life with them more if I want them to understand me better.
