              <h2>First Blog posting~!</h2>
        <p>2014. 09. 18</p>

          <p>This is my first ever blog posting. Althogh I am not a good writer or enjoy writing, I will start to like it and someday I expect to see myself enjoying it!

          As being an electrical engineering student, I had few chances to play with programming, so I know about half of the terms. BUT, I was not sure what they really meant. After reading few desctiptions and watching vidoes, I think I get what those mean. I will talk about few things that I learned last 2 days.</br></br>

          <span>What are the benefits of version control?</span></br></br>

          Version control is having a timestamp of your work and your work can branches out and have several different versions in parallel with a timestamp for each of them. This helps you to go back and forth the versions where you want to go back and change. This also allow other people to work on the same thing from different branches and it does not affect others' work.</br></br>

          <span>How does git help you keep track of changes?</span></br></br>

          Git is the one that allow you to do the "Version control" that keep all the versions of your work. You can save(push) any changes you make on your work(code) with some descriptions and that "save(push)" is assigned with a (commit) number, and the commits can be listed out, used to retrieve the previous version of your work before you make those changes that you want to cancel and start again.</br></br>

          <span>Why use GitHub to store your code?</span></br></br>

          GitHub is a user-friendly tool that allows you to upload your code online publicly or privately as you want. Since GitHub is online, anyone who has permission to access to your code can view and contribute to the project. Furthermore, people can work on the same part of a project without ruining others' work. There is one branch called "master" is the one that keeps the main/working-fine/perfect/best version of the whole project. There can be as many branches as you want to keep different versions of your work and each branch will keep it's own versions with commit numbers and can be retrieved as wanted.</br></br>

          Thanks for reading. I know it's really bad for now. I will get better for sure! haha</p>
