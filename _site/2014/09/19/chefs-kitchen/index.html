              <h2>Dev Bootcamp? I'm going there in 2 months!</h2>
        <p>2014. 09. 19</p>

        <p>After I heard about App Academy from someone I know, I really wanted to go there, so I studied Ruby and prepared for interviews for a/A. While I was doing that, I researched coding bootcamps in general and realized that this is pretty new and there are a lot of bootcamps. Among those, I picked DBC as my second option with few reasons such as it’s originality, reputation, and cost. After I picked those two academies, and as the interviewing process goes through, I felt that DBC is more appealing to me because of the way DBC interviews people and its prep work, Phase 0. Before starting the actually program on site, I think it is really good to have solid preparation to get familiar with the basic stuffs and know my current stage of becoming a developer and also the possibility. This will prevent wasting time during the onsite program. Also another thing that I found DBC more appealing is that DBC cares about people. It was pretty interesting to watch the engineering empathy video as a part of interview preparation. I totally understand the importance of it and want to get the skills to communicate appropriately with other engineers and leadership skills.</br></br>

        Like all other students in DBC, I have a passion to become a software engineer, but I don’t want to take too many risks. That is why I chose to go to DBC and I am expecting a lot of challenges including learning the technical skills and also getting used to the culture. I personally see myself as a person who gets adjusted well to a new environment.  However, I am a bit slow on understanding something fully. I am nervous to jump into DBC’s independent, harsh and fast-moving environment. Besides getting nervous, I really excited to be a part of that. Unless I fail to follow the main flow, I will get to finish this awesome bootcamp and be ready to become a software engineer.  As mentioned in the video,  "Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table," I will have the “Kitchen mindset” and bring my apron and knife there and do my thing and come out as a successful graduate.  I expect to have a good teaching assistance whom I will ask tons of questions at DBC. ;)
